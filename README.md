## Find@SG
This is a small web app demostrating several interesting locations within Singapore, with the help of the Google Map API.

### Steps to Run the Application

1. Download the repository to your local machine and open the index.html file, or go to the test site: http://znss1989.github.io/mapAppSG/.

2. Inspect the Find@SG site. On desktop, the list view is automatically toggled on, other wise for small screen devices. But you can switch it as you like.

3. Select one location either directly on map marker, or in list view will display the name of the location and even some more information from Wikipedia.

4. Filtering the locations is possible with keywords within the text input area.
